TODO: This is where we would document the model interface and the dataset
standard/format expected.

This should also contain a usage or getting started section at the top that
describes how to go through the steps of preprocessing a CSV dataset (and point
you to the document that lays out the CSV dataset standard/format rules), how to
invoke the training pipeline, how to evaluate the model, etc.

## Usage

### Creating a new sample index

### Visualizing a dataset's state-space

### Balancing a dataset

### Fitting a model to the dataset

### Evaluating the model in different scenarios
